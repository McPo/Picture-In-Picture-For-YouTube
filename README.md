Picture-In-Picture For YouTube™
===============================

* Docks YouTube™ videos to the corner of the screen allowing seamless browsing between tabs and applications.

* By pressing a newly added button |PIP| beside the |Like| button present on a YouTube page, This extension will launch a small video player which remains on top of all windows, Including Applications such as Microsoft Word etc. Allowing you to get on with your daily work while watching your favourite YouTube™ videos, Or docking a tutorial video above an Application you are working with.

* It works without any plugins and takes advantage of Google Chrome's Notification Feature. This allows for multiple Videos to be stacked upon each other. There are plans to extend this to other Sites and Video Providers to allow embedded videos to be compatible.

* The Video being docked must allow the user to embed it. This is not the case with some Catch-Up TV Services, Although all User Content is possible.

* Upon first use an option page will appear allowing the opportunity to change a few of the default settings.

* It is safe for use in Incognito-Mode.

FAQ
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Can I re-size the window?
The size is limited by the HTMLNotification implemented within Chrome. It is unlikely this will be expanded to allow larger sizes has it has recently been dropped from the specification and now only exists within Chrome.

### How can I position the window?
You can position the window in one of four corners, by pressing the spanner on the window handle and selecting an option under 'Choose position'. This is how the Chrome team has decided to implement this particular functionality.

### Some users report it doesnt work?
This was my fault. I was aware of the upcoming changes but had not realised they had been in effect as I was a few revisions behind.

### Will new features be added?
I have no plans to continue work on the extension beyond maintenance. The extension was developed to complement my workflow which has now changed.

Last year a version was close to completion which would have allowed viewing embedded videos on all video hosting websites. Unfortunately the software was lost and I have no plans to reimplement it.
